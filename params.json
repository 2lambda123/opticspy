{"name":"Opticspy","tagline":"python optics module","body":"\r\n#opticspy  \r\n\r\nOpticspy is a python module for optics application. I want to this for a long time. One reason is I know both optics and python, so why no develop some optics tools? The second reason is that there is not much opensource, easy-to-use optics program module(Matlab has great functions but do not specify to optics application). I want this module could be developed in to a core for a future web application for optics. \r\nNow it is concentrated on interferometers, optical metrology and wave propagation. And most methods in opticspy based on Zernike Polynomials.\r\n\r\n##There are some examples opticspy module:   \r\n   \r\n###1. [Zernike Polynomial Methods](http://sterncat.github.io/files/Zernike_Polynomial_Method.html)\r\n\r\n###2. [Zernike Polynomial Fitting Methods](http://sterncat.github.io/files/Zernike_Polynomial_Fitting_Method.html)  \r\n\r\n###3. [Interferometer Methods](http://sterncat.github.io/files/Interferometer_Method.html) \r\n\r\n###4. [Phase shift interferometer and surface rebuild](http://sterncat.github.io/files/PSI.html)\r\n\r\n###5. [Wave Propagation and Aberration Methods](http://sterncat.github.io/files/Diffraction_Method.html)   \r\n\r\n###6. [Lens aberration, Jones matrix and gauss beam methods ](http://sterncat.github.io/files/Other_functions.html)  \r\n\r\n##There are some interesting gifs from opticspy:\r\n\r\n###1. [Zernike Surface](http://sterncat.github.io/images/zernikegif.gif)\r\n\r\n###This project is hosted on github in [https://github.com/Sterncat/opticspy](https://github.com/Sterncat/opticspy)\r\n\r\n##How to use\r\n```\r\n>>> import opticspy\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd just have fun with it!\r\n\r\n## What I want\r\n<ul>\r\n  <li>1. After import the module and you will get some functions that can do some calculation and education in optics</li>\r\n  <li>2. Parameters should be very flexible, and the results should be shown in visualized, intuitionistic figures.</li>\r\n  <li>3. Based on Zernike Polynomials.\r\n  <li>4. After development of core, I want it be dynamic web application(with Javascript)</li>\r\n  <li>5. I even hope one day it will become a part of online optics design application, who knows?</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n##TODO:\r\n* ✓ Zernike Polynomials surface(3D), map(2D), cutoff of 3D(1D)\r\n* ✓ Zernike Coefficient calculation\r\n* ✓ Zernike Polynomials Surface Fitting Method\r\n* ✓ Twyman Green interferometer\r\n* ✓ Lateral Shear interferometer\r\n* ✓ Phase shift interferometer(Several phase unwrap algorithm)\r\n* ✓ Several kinds of apertures\r\n* ✓ Apertures' Fresnel and Frauhofer diffraction pattern, OTF\r\n* ✓ Third order ray aberration, distortion and field curvature calculation\r\n* ✓ Surface based on Seidel coefficients\r\n* ✓ Zernike to Seidel coefficients interconversion\r\n* Star test\r\n* Geometric matrix calculation\r\n* Some freeform theory\r\n* PSF, OTF and MTF calculation\r\n* More interferometer(Twyman Green, Shearing, etc)\r\n* Ray tracing\r\n* high order aberration calculation\r\n* Make it rock!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n##Authors and Contributors\r\nI am Xing Fan.
