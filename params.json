{"name":"Opticspy","tagline":"python optics module","body":"\r\n#opticspy  \r\n\r\nOpticspy is a python module for optics application. I want to this for a long time. One reason is I know both optics and python, so why no develop some optics tools? The second reason is that there is not much opensource, easy-to-use optics program module(matlab has great fuctions but do not specify to optics application). I want this could be developed in to a core for a future web application for optics.\r\n\r\n##There are some examples opticspy module:   \r\n   \r\n###1. [Wave Propagation and Aberration Methods](http://sterncat.github.io/files/Aperture_Method.html)    \r\n  \r\n###2. [Interferometer Methods](http://sterncat.github.io/files/Interferometer_Method.html)  \r\n  \r\n###3. [Zernike Polynomial Methods](http://sterncat.github.io/files/Zernike_Polynomial_Method.html)\r\n\r\n###4. [Zernike Polynomial Fitting Methods](http://sterncat.github.io/files/Zernike_Polynomial_Fitting_Method.html)    \r\n\r\n###This project is hosted on github in [https://github.com/Sterncat/opticspy](https://github.com/Sterncat/opticspy)\r\n\r\n##How to use\r\n```\r\n>>> import opticspy\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd just have fun with it!\r\n\r\n## What I want\r\n<ul>\t\r\n  <li>1. After import the module and you will get some functions that can do some calculation and education in optics</li>\r\n  <li>2. Parameters should be very flexible, and the results should be shown in visualized, intuitionistic figures.</li>\r\n  <li>3. After development of core, I want it be dynamic web application(with Javascript)</li>\r\n  <li>4. I even hope one day it will become a part of online optics design application, who knows?</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n##TODO:\r\n* ✓ Rectangular, circle diffraction pattern, OTF\r\n* ✓ Third order ray aberration plot\r\n* ✓ Twyman_Green interferogram with aberration\r\n* ✓ Lateral Shear interferogram with aberration\r\n* ✓ Zernike Coefficient calculation\r\n* ✓ Zernike Polynomials surface(3D), map(2D), cutoff of 3D(1D)\r\n* ✓ Zernike Polynomials Fitting Method\r\n* ✓ Diffraction: generate diffraction pattern\r\n* Geometric matrix calculation\r\n* Some freeform theory\r\n* PSF, OTF and MTF calculation\r\n* Several interferogram(Twyman Green, Shearing, etc)\r\n* Ray tracing\r\n* Zernike coefficients, surface and surface fitting\r\n* Third and high order aberration calculation\r\n* Make it rock!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n##Authors and Contributors\r\nI am Xing Fan. An optics master student now studying in the [Institute of Optics](http://www.optics.rochester.edu/), [University of Rochester](http://www.rochester.edu/). \r\n\r\nAnd this is my personal blog [Marvin's Neverland!](http://sterncat.github.io)\r\n\r\n##Support or Contact\r\nIf you have questions and advice, or want to participate in this project, contact me at marvin.fanxing@gmail.com.
