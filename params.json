{"name":"Opticspy","tagline":"python optics module","body":"\r\n###Python module opticspy\r\n\r\nOpticspy is a python module for optics application. I want to this for a long time. One reason is I know both optics and python, so why no develop some optics tools? The second reason is that there is not much opensource, easy-to-use optics program module(matlab has great fuctions but do not specify to optics application). I want this could be developed in to a core for a future web application for optics.\r\n\r\n### What I want\r\n<ul>\t\r\n  <li>1. After import the module and you will get some functions that can use to do some calculation and education in optics</li>\r\n  <li>2. Parameters should be very flexible, and the results should be shown in visualized, intuitionistic figures.</li>\r\n  <li>3. After development of core, I want it be dynamic web application(with Javascript)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n\r\n### What I want to contain in the module\r\nI think the module should contain bunch of things in optics.\r\n<ul>\r\n  <li>1. Diffraction: generate diffraction pattern</li>\r\n  <li>2. Geometric matrix calculation</li>\r\n  <li>3. PSF, OTF and MTF calculation</li>\r\n  <li>4. Several interferogram(Twyman Green, Shearing, etc)</li>\r\n  <li>5. Ray tracing</li>\r\n  <li>6. Zernike coefficients</li>\r\n  <li>7. Third and high order aberration caculation</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### What I have done\r\n> [Here](http://sterncat.github.io/files/opticspy_1.html) is some example of this opticspy module.\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n  <li>1. Rectangular, circle diffraction pattern, OTF</li>\r\n  <li>2. Third order ray abberation plot</li>\r\n  <li>3. Twyman_Green interferogram with aberration</li>\r\n  <li>4. Lateral Shear interferogram with aberration</li>\r\n  <li>5. Zernike Coefficient</li>\r\n</ul>","google":"UA-60204155-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
