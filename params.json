{"name":"Opticspy","tagline":"python optics module","body":"\r\n##Python module opticspy\r\n\r\nOpticspy is a python module for optics application. I want to this for a long time. One reason is I know both optics and python, so why no develop some optics tools? The second reason is that there is not much opensource, easy-to-use optics program module(matlab has great fuctions but do not specify to optics application). I want this could be developed in to a core for a future web application for optics.\r\n\r\n##There are some examples opticspy module:   \r\n   \r\n###1. [Aperture Method](http://sterncat.github.io/files/Aperture_Method.html)    \r\n  \r\n###2. [Interferometer Method](http://sterncat.github.io/files/Interferometer_Method.html)  \r\n  \r\n###3. [Zernike Method](http://sterncat.github.io/files/Zernike_Method.html)  \r\n\r\n##How to use\r\n```\r\n>>> import opticspy\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd just have fun with it!\r\n\r\n## What I want\r\n<ul>\t\r\n  <li>1. After import the module and you will get some functions that can do some calculation and education in optics</li>\r\n  <li>2. Parameters should be very flexible, and the results should be shown in visualized, intuitionistic figures.</li>\r\n  <li>3. After development of core, I want it be dynamic web application(with Javascript)</li>\r\n  <li>4. I even hope one day it will become a part of online optics design application, who knows?</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n\r\n## What I want to contain in the module\r\nI think the module should contain bunch of things in optics.\r\n<ul>\r\n  <li>1. Diffraction: generate diffraction pattern</li>\r\n  <li>2. Geometric matrix calculation</li>\r\n  <li>3. PSF, OTF and MTF calculation</li>\r\n  <li>4. Several interferogram(Twyman Green, Shearing, etc)</li>\r\n  <li>5. Ray tracing</li>\r\n  <li>6. Zernike coefficients, surface and surface fitting</li>\r\n  <li>7. Third and high order aberration calculation</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n## What I have done\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n  <li>1. Rectangular, circle diffraction pattern, OTF</li>\r\n  <li>2. Third order ray aberration plot</li>\r\n  <li>3. Twyman_Green interferogram with aberration</li>\r\n  <li>4. Lateral Shear interferogram with aberration</li>\r\n  <li>5. Zernike Coefficient calculation</li>\r\n  <li>6. Zernike Polynomials surface(3D), map(2D), cutoff of 3D(1D)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n##Authors and Contributors\r\nI am Xing Fan. An optics master student now studying in the [Institute of Optics](http://www.optics.rochester.edu/), [University of Rochester](http://www.rochester.edu/). \r\n\r\nAnd this is my personal blog [Marvin's Neverland!](http://sterncat.github.io)\r\n\r\n##Support or Contact\r\nIf you have questions and advice, or want to participate in this project, contact me at marvin.fanxing@gmail.com. I would be very happy to find some one have the same interest!\r\n\r\n","google":"UA-60204155-1","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
