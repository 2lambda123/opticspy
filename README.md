###Begin to develop python module opticspy

I want to this for a long time. And I think it is nice and interesting to develop some python module for myself. One reason is to practice python programming and the other reason is that there not much opensource easy-to-use optics program module(matlab has great fuctions but do not specify to optics application).

This project is hosted on github in [https://github.com/Sterncat/opticspy](https://github.com/Sterncat/opticspy)

### What should contain in the module
It is just a note for myself. I think the module should contain these things in optics(list will change)
<ul>
  <li>1. Diffraction: generate diffraction pattern</li>
  <li>2. Geometric matrix calculation</li>
  <li>3. OTF and MTF calculation</li>
</ul>

### What I want
<ul>	
  <li>1. After import the module and you will get some functions that can use to do some calculation and education in optics</li>
    <li>2. Parameters should be very flexible, and the results should be shown in visualized, intuitionistic figures.</li>
    <li>3. After development of core, I want it be dynamic web application(with Javascript)</li>
</ul>

### What I have done
> [Here](http://sterncat.github.io/files/opticspy_1.html) is some example of this opticspy module.
