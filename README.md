Opticspy is a python module for optics application. I want to this for a long time. One reason is I know both optics and python, so why no develop some optics tools? The second reason is that there is not much opensource, easy-to-use optics program module(matlab has great fuctions but do not specify to optics application). I want this could be developed in to a core for a future web application for optics.

###There are some examples opticspy module:   
   
####1. [Wave Propagation and Aberration Methods](http://sterncat.github.io/files/Diffraction_Method.html)    
  
####2. [Interferometer Methods](http://sterncat.github.io/files/Interferometer_Method.html)  
  
####3. [Zernike Polynomial Methods](http://sterncat.github.io/files/Zernike_Polynomial_Method.html)

####4. [Zernike Polynomial Fitting Methods](http://sterncat.github.io/files/Zernike_Polynomial_Fitting_Method.html)  

####5. [Phase shift interferometer and surface rebuild](http://sterncat.github.io/files/PSI.html)    
  
####This is the [Opticspy project page](http://sterncat.github.io/opticspy/)

##How to use
```
>>> import opticspy
```

And just have fun with it!

## What I want
<ul>	
  <li>1. After import the module and you will get some functions that can do some calculation and education in optics</li>
  <li>2. Parameters should be very flexible, and the results should be shown in visualized, intuitionistic figures.</li>
  <li>3. After development of core, I want it be dynamic web application(with Javascript)</li>
  <li>4. I even hope one day it will become a part of online optics design application, who knows?</li>
</ul>

##TODO:
* ✓ Rectangular, circle, double circle, frame, etc aperture
* ✓ Third order ray aberration plot
* ✓ Twyman_Green interferogram with aberration
* ✓ Lateral Shear interferogram with aberration
* ✓ Zernike Coefficient calculation
* ✓ Zernike Polynomials surface(3D), map(2D), cutoff of 3D(1D), PSF
* ✓ Zernike Polynomials Fitting Method
* ✓ Diffraction: generate diffraction pattern
* ✓ Convert Zernike to Seidel coefficient
* ✓ Seidel aberrations surface and interferogram
* ✓ Fresnel and Fraunhofer diffraction 
* Geometric matrix calculation
* Some freeform theory
* PSF, OTF and MTF calculation
* More interferogram
* Ray tracing
* Third and high order aberration calculation
* Make it rock!
